						For my final project I will be looking at Montreals Indigenous peoples population. The project will be following the first option which is computational essay.

					<ul>
					<p>
						To be able to do the research, I will need to gather some data<br>
						<li>I will be looking at <a href="https://www.donneesquebec.ca/organisation/ville-de-montreal/" target="_blank">DONNEES QUEBEC</a> to download GeoJson files that shows exact locations of hospitals and health care centres in Montreal</li>
						<li>I will gather my main data from <a href="http://datacentre.chass.utoronto.ca.lib-ezproxy.concordia.ca/census/" target="_blank"> CHASS</a> where I will be looking at: Population of 2016, Average age of the population, Income, Average Household Size, Ethnic Origin </li>
					</p>
					</ul>

					<p>
						<b>The goal of the project</b> will be to look at the relationship between: neighbourhoods that Indigenous people reside and approximity of healthcare centers to them, Average household size and income, average age and approximity of healthcare centers.
						<br><br>
						I chose this topic because human rights is one of the most important things that everyone should value and respect but when big governments such as Canada do not show that towards its people, a lot of questions start to arise. However, having nearby healthcare centres or even clean water that we all take for granted might not be something that indigenous people have in their daily lives. Thus, I chose this topic to understand better about the life that Indigenous peoples live in
						in Montreal and hopefully be able to raise awareness about it.
						<br></br>
						The project will be in a website form, for which I will be creating maps using Python and also I will be using general programming techniques(HTML, CSS, JS) to put all my contenct (writing and maps) in a website.
